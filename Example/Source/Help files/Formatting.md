# Formatting Text

Quick Note supports basic markdown formatting. You can add formatting like bold, italics code and headers.

## Headers
To create a heading, add number/pound signs (#) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. For example, to create a heading level three, use three number/pound signs

Eg:  
```
### Level 3 Header
```

## Emphasis

### Bold
To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase.

Eg:
```
This is a <b>**bold**</b> text. This is also <b>__bold__</b>
```

### Italic
To italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase.

Eg:
```
This is a <i>*italic*</i> text. This is also <i>_italic_</i>
```

### Code
To denote a word or phrase as code, enclose it in backticks (`).
Eg:
```
This is a `code` example
```
